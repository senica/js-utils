# Utils for NodeJS

I'll add to this collection as I find stuff to use in projects.
Mostly prototype and small utils that I use in various projects

# Usage
I don't have this in the NPM repo as right now there's nothing worthy of it,
but if you want to use it...
`npm install https://github.com/senica/js-utils.git`

# Current utilities
- String.capitalize

# Contributing
This should only have utils that are not already in other libraries.
Generally this is some gold nugget you find on StackOverflow.
If adding a snippet from the internet, please add a link comment where you
got it from
1. Fork this rep `https://github.com/senica/js-utils.git`
2. Clone the newly forked repo to your computer
3. Run `npm install`
4. Add to the index.js file
5. Write some tests in the test directory and test it `make test`
You can put all the tests in one file and we can rename it.
